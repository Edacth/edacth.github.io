    <h3>What a feeling.</h3>
    I created this repo the month I graduated college which was apparently *6 years ago*, to my surprise.
    I'm about to do some interesting stuff and I need a place to host it, share it, give it voice. 
    I'm gonna try stuff and see what sticks. This is one of those objects of dubious stickiness. I don't really do web dev so I'm keeping it simple,
